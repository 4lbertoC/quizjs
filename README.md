# QuizJs

A web-based platform for live quizzes.

It consists of a __master__ client, one or more __player__ clients and a __server__ to handle the communication between them.

# Game Mechanics

- The master resets the game state and asks a question.
- The players who want to answer subscribe to the question (like if they pressed a _buzzer button_).
- The first player who subscribes can give the answer, while the other players are added to a queue.
- If the answer is wrong, the master skips to the next player in the queue until either the answer is right or the queue is empty.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save quizjs
```

## Usage

The package contains a basic socket.io server that can be run with:

```sh
$ node implementations/socket.io/quizjs-socket.io.js
```

The socket.io player and master clients are built into the `dist` directory by simply running:

```sh
$ grunt
```

There are no UI components included included in this package.

[Here][simple-player] you can find a simple player implementation.

## Server API

### `QuizJsServer#registerPlayer()`
Registers a new player to the QuizJs server and returns its ID.

### `QuizJsServer#subscribe(playerId)`
Subscribes a player to the current question.

### `QuizJsServer#nextSubscriber()`
Passes the turn to the next subscriber.

### `QuizJsServer#resetState()`
Empties the current subscriber queue and allows all the players to subscribe for a new question.

The QuizJs server also implements the following methods of [events.EventEmitter][node-event-emitter]: `on`, `once`, `removeListener`, `removeAllListeners`.

## Server Events

### `quizjs-register-player`
Sent when a player is registered to the QuizJs server.

### `quizjs-state-reset`
Sent when the QuizJs server state is reset.

### `quizjs-state-update`
Sent when the QuizJs server state is updated.
